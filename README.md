# Snake Game & Space Wars
<br>
This repository contains two exciting games built using the **raylib** library:
<br>
1. **Snake Game**: A classic Snake game where you control a snake to collect food and grow longer. Avoid colliding with walls and your own body! <br>
2. **Space Wars**: A fast-paced space shooter where you fight against waves of enemies in space.
<br>
Both games are developed with raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library for creating graphical applications.
